# About Python Programming
--> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br><br>
--> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.
.<br><br>
--> Python is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library .<br>

--> Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.<br><br>
--> It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.<br><br>
--> Machine Learning algorithm learns from experience E with respect to some type of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.<br>

<h2>1. Supervised Learning</h2>
--> Basically supervised learning is when we teach or train the machine using data that is well-labelled. <br><br>
--> Which means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.<br><br>
--> After that, the machine is provided with a new set of examples(data) so that the supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data(set of training examples) and produces a correct outcome from labeled data.<br><br>

<h3>i) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) </h3>

--> K-Nearest Neighbours is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning.<br><br>
--> It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection..<br><br>
--> In this algorithm,we identify category based on neighbors.<br><br>

<h3>ii) Support Vector Machines (SVM) </h3>

--> The main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the different classes in the training data. <br><br>
--> This is done by finding the hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. <br><br>
--> Once the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining on which side of the hyperplane it falls. <br><br>
--> SVMs are particularly useful when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of separation in the data.<br><br>

<h3>iii) Naive Bayes Classifiers</h3>

--> Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. <br><br>
--> It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.<br><br>
--> The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an independent and equal contribution to the outcome.<br><br>

<h3>iv) Decision Tree</h3>

--> It builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label.<br><br>
--> It is constructed by recursively splitting the training data into subsets based on the values of the attributes until a stopping criterion is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node.<br><br>
--> The goal is to find the attribute that maximizes the information gain or the reduction in impurity after the split.<br><br>

<h3>v) Random Forest</h3>

--> It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.<br><br>
--> Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.<br><br>
--> The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.<br><br>

<h2>2. Unsupervised Learning</h2>

--> Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.<br><br>
--> Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. <br><br>
